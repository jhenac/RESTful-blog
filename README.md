# RESTful-blog
Upgraded blog using RESTful routing.

The program stores and queries blog data from an SQL database. It uses flask framework with jinja templating, flask_bootstrap, SQLAlchemy, WTForms, and CKEditor.
Blog posts will be displayed in the homepage. There is an option to add new post as well as delete a post. A post can be clicked to display full contents and can
be edited. A form is displayed for adding or editing posts. When editing a post, the form is pre-populated with the existing data in the database. It follows the 
concept of RESTful routing or representational state transfer in displaying, adding, or deleting data from the database.
